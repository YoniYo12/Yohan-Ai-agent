Yohan AI is a full-stack study assistant that helps users learn more efficiently through AI-generated flashcards, quizzes, and an interactive chat tutor. The project uses a React frontend and a Flask backend to create a simple and intuitive learning experience powered by the OpenAI API. Users can generate flashcards from any topic, take automatically scored multiple-choice quizzes, and chat with an AI tutor that provides clear explanations and study guidance.

The backend is built with Python and Flask, using environment variables to securely handle the OpenAI API key and Flask-CORS to allow communication with the frontend. The frontend is built in React with basic CSS, keeping the interface lightweight and easy to use. Communication between the client and server is done through clean REST API routes for flashcards, quizzes, and chat.

Yohan AI was created as a beginner-friendly AI project that demonstrates how to combine a modern JavaScript frontend with a Python backend, while integrating real AI behavior in a practical and useful way. It provides a foundation for more advanced features like authentication, data storage, and user history, and serves as a solid example of building a real-world AI-powered web application from scratch.
